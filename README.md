# Fire's up on our Telegram Bot ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
it's the finall version of our Telegram Bot API integrated in a todo App, take a look on. 

## Welcome again in our ToDo App!

### What is it?
Our application seamlessly blends the power of a ToDo list with the convenience of Telegram messaging. With our innovative integration, managing your tasks has never been easier.

### Why use our app?
- **Effortless Task Management**: Add, update, and delete tasks with ease, all within the user interface.
- **Stay Organized Anywhere**: Access your ToDo list from anywhere.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive instant updates on your tasks directly in Telegram, ensuring you never miss an important deadline.

### What's new in this version?
In this latest version of our app, we've revamped the way our Telegram bot interacts with users. Instead of handling individual tasks, the bot now serves as a conduit for communication between users and our backend PHP server. This allows for a smoother user experience and greater flexibility in managing tasks.

### How does it work?
1. **User Interaction**: Use our intuitive Telegram bot interface to add, update, or delete tasks.
2. **Bot Data Management**: The Telegram bot collects user data and forwards it to our backend PHP file, where it is securely stored.
3. **Task Distribution**: When a new task is added, our backend PHP file sends it through the Telegram API to all registered users, ensuring everyone stays up-to-date.

### Get Started!
Ready to experience the future of task management? Follow these simple steps to get started:
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Abdessamed2002/Bot-ToDoApp.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install node-telegram-bot-api`
3. **Configure the Bot**: Set up your Telegram bot and configure the webhook URL to point to your backend PHP file.
4. **Run the App**: `npm start`
5. **Start Managing Tasks**: Add, update, or delete tasks through the Telegram bot interface and watch as they seamlessly sync across all your devices.
